## What does a doctype do ?

There are now three modes used by the layout engines in web browsers: `quirks mode(怪异模式)`, `almost standards mode(非标准模式)`, and `full standards mode(标准模式)`.

For HTML documents, browsers use a `DOCTYPE` in the beginning of the document to decide whether to handle it in `quirks mode` or `standards mode`
